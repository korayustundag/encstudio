# Encryption Studio

Encryption Studio is free and always free.

## Getting Started

Sit back and enjoy your safety. Are you ready to make this software the world's most secure software? Without asking for wages from anyone! Come on then! Lets start...

### Program Algorithm (Simple)

Encrypt

```

* Plain colors(Preferably red and white)
* Red Color(RGB(R:238 G:27 B:75) - CMYK(C:0 M:95 Y:57 K:0))
* Multi-language support

### The code structure that should be

* The best code snippets that should be for encryption and data security.
* To test possible security vulnerabilities and system faults and remove them.
